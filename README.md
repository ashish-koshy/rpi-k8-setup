This repository contains shell scripts that automates the process of setting up a Kubernetes Cluster out of Raspberry Pis.

For OS specific instructions, refer to the `README.md` within the directory with the name of the OS. For e.g: [ubuntu](https://github.com/ashish-koshy/rpi-k8-setup/blob/main/ubuntu/README.md)

# Demo
[Here](https://blog.ashishkoshy.me/#/raspberry-pi-kubernetes-cluster-part-1) is my blog that extensively documents the setup of Kubernetes using Raspberry Pis. 
This blog was served from the same cluster that it teaches you how to build!
